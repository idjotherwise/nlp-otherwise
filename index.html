# Croeso! Welcome!

I am a data scientist, and here I will be posting some discussions about things I find interesting. Mostly stuff about Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, general Data Analysis and Covid data.
## Other websites
- This is a FastAPI website to check what the weather is currently anywhere in the world [weatherotherwise.xyz](https://weatherotherwise.xyz)
- [dataotherwise.xyz](https://dataotherwise.xyz) is running on a Shiny server (see [rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) and uses R to
plot graphs related to Covid as well as overlaying the data on maps.
