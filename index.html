# Croeso! Welcome!

I am a data scientist, and here I will be posting some discussions about things I find interesting. Mostly stuff about Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, general Data Analysis and Covid data.
## My other websites
- [tybed.com](htttps://www.tybed.com) is a website that you can enter a URL to get the summary of the text content from that website. Note that the backend uses a free Heroku dyno, so it might take a few seconds to wake up.
- [tybednext.vercel.app](https://tybednext.vercel.app/) is my new blog made with Next.js
- My online CV: [idjotherwise.github.io/markdown-cv/](https://idjotherwise.github.io/markdown-cv/)
- This is a FastAPI website to check what the weather is currently anywhere in the world [weatherotherwise.xyz](https://weatherotherwise.xyz)
- [dataotherwise.xyz](https://dataotherwise.xyz) is running on a Shiny server (see [rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) and uses R to
plot graphs related to Covid as well as overlaying the data on maps.
- [fastbooks.herokuapp.com](https://fastbooks.herokuapp.com/) A place to keep track of books that I've been recommended.. (made with FastAPI and plain jinja HTML templates).
