I am a freelance data scientist, specialising in Natural Language Processing and
 Machine Learning. My background is in pure mathematics, having obtained a PhD
 in 2019 - my mathematics articles from my time as a PhD student can be found
 on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Johnston%2C+Ifan&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50).

My main interest is in NLP, where I am exploring multi-lingual sentiment analysis models.

If you would like to get in touch, you can reach me at my email on the bottom of this page.
