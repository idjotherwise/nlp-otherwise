I am a freelance data scientist, specialising in Natural Language Processing and
 Machine Learning. My background is in pure mathematics, having obtained a PhD
 in 2019 - my mathematics articles from my time as a PhD student can be found
 on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Johnston%2C+Ifan&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50).

My main interest is in NLP, where I am exploring multi-lingual sentiment analysis models. When I'm playing around with data, I enjoy building small websites (with [fastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)), skiing (in the Austrian Alps) and playing games (both computer and board!)

If you would like to get in touch, you can reach me at my email on the bottom of this page.
